# 501_Assignment
**A mini project of the current design for DHGA501**
## This is just an interactive map showing the percentage of languages ​​used in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu.<br><br>
_Due to the special status of Mandarin, I added a switch option to exclude it from the display_ <br><br>
You can view it by clicking on the HTML file (taiwan_language_map.html) directly. It is currently a very simple version.
<br>The language usage percentages used in this map come from the results of the Taiwan Population and Housing Census conducted in 2010, including the primary and secondary languages.<br>
Geographic data, more accurate administrative division data of cities and counties, comes from https://github.com/ronnywang/twgeojson, which is the administrative division of Taiwan after 2010.
